## code implementation


### 1.**AddBook**
The Add Book feature allows users to create and submit a new book entry into the bookstore's inventory. This functionality is accessible via the Add Book form, which prompts users to input essential details for the new book.
```java
@GetMapping("/add")
	public String addBook(Model model) {
		model.addAttribute("book", new Book());
		return "form";
	}
```
### 2.**DeleteBook**
The Delete Book feature allows users to remove a book from the bookstore's inventory. This functionality is essential for maintaining an up-to-date collection by enabling users to delete any books that are no longer available or necessary.
```java
 public String deleteBook(@PathVariable Long id, RedirectAttributes redirect) {
		bookService.delete(id);
		redirect.addFlashAttribute("successMessage", "Deleted book successfully!");
		return "redirect:/book";
	}
```

### 3.**PlaceOrder**
The Place Order feature enables customers to finalize their purchase by placing an order for items in their shopping cart. This functionality is crucial for completing transactions and ensuring customers receive their ordered products.

```java
public String placeOrder(@Valid Customer customer, BindingResult result, RedirectAttributes redirect) {
		if (result.hasErrors()) {
			return "/checkout";
		}
		billingService.createOrder(customer, shoppingCartService.getCart());
		//emailService.sendEmail(customer.getEmail(), "bookstore - Order Confirmation", "Your order has been confirmed.");
		shoppingCartService.emptyCart();
		redirect.addFlashAttribute("successMessage", "The order is confirmed, check your email.");
		return "redirect:/cart";
	}
```
### 4.**Checkout**
The Checkout feature allows customers to review their shopping cart and input their information before placing an order. This functionality is vital for finalizing purchases and ensuring a smooth transition from shopping to ordering.

```java
public String checkout(Model model) {
		List<Book> cart = shoppingCartService.getCart();
		if (cart.isEmpty()) {
			return "redirect:/cart";
		}
		model.addAttribute("customer", new Customer());
		model.addAttribute("productsInCart", cart);
		model.addAttribute("totalPrice", shoppingCartService.totalPrice().toString());
		model.addAttribute("shippingCosts", shoppingCartService.getshippingCosts());
		return "checkout";
	}
```
### 5.**AddToCart**
This method adds a specific book to the user's shopping cart based on the book's unique ID.

```java
public String addToCart(@PathVariable("id") Long id, RedirectAttributes redirect) {
		List<Book> cart = shoppingCartService.getCart();
		Book book = bookService.findBookById(id).get();
		if (book != null) {
			cart.add(book);
		}
		shoppingCartService.getSession().setAttribute("cart", cart);
		redirect.addFlashAttribute("successMessage", "Added book successfully!");
		return "redirect:/cart";
	}
```


### 6.**RemoveFromCart**
This method removes a specific book from the user's shopping cart based on the book's unique ID.

```java
@GetMapping("/remove/{id}")
	public String removeFromCart(@PathVariable("id") Long id, RedirectAttributes redirect) {
		Book book = bookService.findBookById(id).get();
		if (book != null) {
			shoppingCartService.deleteProductWithId(id);
		}
		redirect.addFlashAttribute("successMessage", "Removed book successfully!");
		return "redirect:/cart";
	}
```



### 7.**RemoveAllFromCart**
 This method clears all items from the user's shopping cart.

 ```java
@GetMapping("/remove/all")
	public String removeAllFromCart() {
		List<Book> cart = shoppingCartService.getCart();
		cart.removeAll(cart);
		return "redirect:/cart";
	}
```
